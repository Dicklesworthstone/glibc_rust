/* CVE-2024-2961: iconv() ISO-2022-CN-EXT buffer overflow reproduction
 *
 * CVSS 8.8 (High) — CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write
 *
 * Root cause: When converting to ISO-2022-CN-EXT, iconv() can write up to
 * 8 bytes beyond the output buffer boundary. The vulnerable code path is
 * triggered by specific escape sequences in the Chinese Extended encoding.
 * The internal state machine emits a multi-byte escape sequence (e.g.,
 * ESC $ ) A for SS2 designation) without first checking whether the
 * remaining output space can accommodate the full sequence.
 *
 * Concrete overflow path in glibc (iconvdata/iso-2022-cn-ext.c):
 *   1. Caller provides an output buffer with < 8 bytes remaining.
 *   2. Converter encounters a character requiring a charset designation
 *      escape sequence (4 bytes: ESC $ ) A/G/H/E).
 *   3. After emitting the escape, it then writes the encoded character
 *      (up to 4 more bytes) WITHOUT re-checking the output boundary.
 *   4. Total overwrite: up to 8 bytes past the end of the output buffer.
 *
 * This reproduction simulates the EXACT memory corruption pattern:
 *   1. Allocate a small heap buffer (simulating iconv's output buffer)
 *   2. Write beyond the buffer bounds (simulating the iconv overflow)
 *   3. Free the buffer (canary corruption detectable here)
 *
 * Stock glibc behavior:
 *   - The 8-byte overwrite corrupts heap metadata or adjacent allocations.
 *   - Depending on heap layout, this may crash at free(), cause silent
 *     corruption, or enable arbitrary code execution via heap feng shui.
 *
 * frankenlibc TSM behavior:
 *   - Trailing canary at buffer end detects the overwrite immediately.
 *   - ClampSize would prevent the overwrite in iconv's internal memcpy.
 *   - At free(), canary verification catches any corruption that slipped
 *     through, and the allocation is safely quarantined.
