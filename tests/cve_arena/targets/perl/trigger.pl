# CVE-2024-56406: Perl tr/// transliteration heap buffer overflow
#
# This script triggers the heap buffer overflow in Perl's tr///
# operator when processing strings with wide Unicode characters.
#
# The bug: When a string contains characters above U+00FF and a
# tr/// operation maps byte-range characters (\x80-\xFF), the
# internal buffer size is calculated based on the original string's
# byte length. However, the transliteration can change the UTF-8
# encoding of characters (e.g., multi-byte -> single-byte), and
# the output may require a different buffer size than allocated.
# The mismatch causes a write past the end of the heap buffer.
#
# With stock glibc: heap metadata corruption -> SIGSEGV or SIGABRT
# With FrankenLibC: canary detects the overflow, ClampSize healing
#                   prevents the corruption from propagating
