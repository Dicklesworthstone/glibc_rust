When something bad happens we want an *audit-grade* trail that survives partial loss (ring-buffer overwrites, sampling, crashes, dropped events) and remains explainable.\n\nRaptorQ's key “alien artifact” idea is **appendable redundancy**:\n- emit cheap *systematic* symbols first (fast path)\n- optionally emit deterministic *repair* symbols later (background cadence)\n- decode and generate proofs offline (harness/tooling), not on the hot path\n\n### Constraints (glibc_rust-specific)\n- No `/dp/asupersync` runtime dependency. Runtime may implement a tiny encoder itself.\n- Strict mode must not pay codec costs on the hot path.\n- Hardened mode may pay bounded overhead but must remain deterministic and measurable.\n\n### Portable Pattern (What We Copy)\n1. **Source block / epoching**\n   - Group a bounded window of evidence events into an *epoch*.\n   - Epoch defines: `K_source` (number of systematic records), `T` (record/symbol size), and seed.\n2. **Systematic fast path**\n   - Emit/store raw evidence records as systematic symbols `ESI = 0..K_source-1`.\n   - Layout should favor sequential capture/export (contiguous run) to minimize read overhead in tooling.\n3. **Deterministic repair generation**\n   - Generate repair symbols `ESI = K_source..K_source+R-1` deterministically from `(epoch_id, K_source, T, policy)`.\n   - Determinism is the superpower: tooling can reproduce encoding schedule and validate.\n4. **Overhead = additive slack + multiplicative budget**\n   - Keep an additive decode slack `slack_decode` (FrankenSQLite V1 uses `+2`).\n   - Add multiplicative overhead `overhead_percent` as needed.\n5. **Anytime-valid tuning**\n   - Use an anytime-valid monitor (e-process) to decide when to raise redundancy.\n   - Record changes in an evidence ledger.\n6. **Decode proofs**\n   - When tooling decodes/repairs, it emits a proof artifact describing which symbols were used and why the decode is trusted.\n\n### Concrete Formulas (From FrankenSQLite Spec Excerpts)\nThese are the “load-bearing” knobs we can reuse verbatim:\n\n- Additive slack:\n  - `slack_decode = 2` (default)\n\n- Repair symbol count selection:\n  - `R = max(slack_decode, ceil(K_source * overhead_percent / 100))`\n\n- Back-of-envelope loss fraction tolerated (engineering approximation):\n  - `loss_fraction_max ≈ max(0, (R - slack_decode) / (K_source + R))`\n\n### Deterministic Seed Derivation (Portable Rule)\nFrankenSQLite uses a deterministic seed derived from a stable identifier (e.g., changeset id):\n- `seed = xxh3_64(id_bytes)`\n\nglibc_rust mapping recommendation:\n- Define an `epoch_id` that is stable within-process (and includes a monotonic counter).\n- Derive seed from `(epoch_id || build_id || mode)` to avoid collisions across runs.\n\n### Record/Envelope Mapping (What We Emit)\nFrankenSQLite’s SymbolRecord idea maps cleanly to libc evidence:\n\n- **EvidenceSymbolRecord** (proposal)\n  - Header: `{ magic, version, epoch_id, seqno, family, mode, action, flags }`\n  - Coding: `{ esi, k_source, r_repair, symbol_size_T, seed }`\n  - Integrity: `{ payload_hash (xxh3_128 or blake3), prev_hash (hash-chain) }`\n  - Payload: fixed-size `T` bytes (small; e.g., 64–256B), or padded.\n\nNotes:\n- “Auth tags” are optional: for libc evidence we may just do hash-chains + optional MAC in tooling.\n- Source symbols should be cheap to write (memcpy into ring buffer + atomic seqno).\n- Repair symbols should be generated on cadence (every N decisions, timer tick, or on exit).\n\n### Where Decode Happens\n- Runtime: encode only (systematic always; repair optional).\n- Harness/tooling: decode, verify hashes/chain, emit DecodeProof.\n\n### Open Design Choice (Explicit)\nWe must choose whether runtime implements:\n- a small XOR-only fountain (LT-like) code (fastest, simplest), or\n- a tighter RaptorQ-compatible schedule (harder), or\n- “RaptorQ-inspired” parity that tooling decodes with a matching decoder.\n\nThis is decided in `bd-3a9`.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria For The Pattern Extraction\n- A concrete mapping of the above into glibc_rust terms (epoch, record format, seed, R selection).\n- Explicit non-goals: no GF(256) Gaussian solve on hot path; no asupersync runtime dep.\n- A minimal test matrix for future implementation:\n  - drop/bitflip simulation\n  - deterministic reproduction\n  - decode-proof verification","created_at":"2026-02-09T21:50:28Z"}]}

HA1zgq_bcAANvqo.jpeg is fundamentally correct as a quality bar:\n1) it must compile and run as a complete unit (not just compile)\n2) it must not secretly rely on system glibc for the hard parts if we claim replacement\n3) TODO stubs cannot exist in the core surface area we claim is implemented\n4) hardest subsystems (loader/startup/NSS/locale/resolv/threading/TLS) need an explicit phased plan\n5) advanced math must be either (a) directly tied to real runtime decisions with evidence+benchmarks, or (b) gated as research.\n\nDeliverable: a bead graph that closes every critique line item with objective evidence (E2E tests, ABI diffs, parity matrix, perf budgets, and proof artifacts).\n\nDefinition of done:\n- E2E LD_PRELOAD smoke suite passes on real programs.\n- Support matrix explicitly marks each API as implemented vs syscall vs glibc-callthrough vs stub.\n- Strict/hardened modes have explicit semantics and perf budgets, enforced by benches.\n- runtime_math is either justified (measured, used) or moved behind opt-in research feature.\n\nVerification Mandate:\n- Every implementation child bead MUST ship comprehensive unit tests and deterministic e2e scripts (strict + hardened where applicable).\n- Every test/e2e execution MUST emit detailed structured logs (trace_id, mode, symbol/API family, decision path, errno/outcome, timing, and artifact pointers).\n- No bead may close without: test commands, expected outputs, and failure-log artifact examples documented in bead notes or linked reports.\n\nEvidence & Test Requirements:\n- Add comprehensive unit tests

Added managed marker (MANAGED_MUTEX_MAGIC) and host fallback wrappers via glibc __pthread_mutex_* symbols. Verified no direct libc::pthread_mutex_(init|destroy|lock|trylock|unlock) calls remain in crates/glibc-rs-abi/src/pthread_abi.rs. Validation: CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/wm-target cargo check -p glibc-rs-abi (pass); scripts/check_replacement_guard.sh interpose (pass, total call-through reduced to 71). Blocking issue: LD_PRELOAD runtime still hangs for mutex fixture runs (timeout in strict+hardened), including /tmp/fixture_mutex_only and c_fixture_suite results at target/c_fixture_suite/20260211T075055Z/results.json; this appears broader startup/interposition behavior beyond direct pthread_mutex_* call-through removal.
