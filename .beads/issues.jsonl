When something bad happens we want an *audit-grade* trail that survives partial loss (ring-buffer overwrites, sampling, crashes, dropped events) and remains explainable.\n\nRaptorQ's key “alien artifact” idea is **appendable redundancy**:\n- emit cheap *systematic* symbols first (fast path)\n- optionally emit deterministic *repair* symbols later (background cadence)\n- decode and generate proofs offline (harness/tooling), not on the hot path\n\n### Constraints (glibc_rust-specific)\n- No `/dp/asupersync` runtime dependency. Runtime may implement a tiny encoder itself.\n- Strict mode must not pay codec costs on the hot path.\n- Hardened mode may pay bounded overhead but must remain deterministic and measurable.\n\n### Portable Pattern (What We Copy)\n1. **Source block / epoching**\n   - Group a bounded window of evidence events into an *epoch*.\n   - Epoch defines: `K_source` (number of systematic records), `T` (record/symbol size), and seed.\n2. **Systematic fast path**\n   - Emit/store raw evidence records as systematic symbols `ESI = 0..K_source-1`.\n   - Layout should favor sequential capture/export (contiguous run) to minimize read overhead in tooling.\n3. **Deterministic repair generation**\n   - Generate repair symbols `ESI = K_source..K_source+R-1` deterministically from `(epoch_id, K_source, T, policy)`.\n   - Determinism is the superpower: tooling can reproduce encoding schedule and validate.\n4. **Overhead = additive slack + multiplicative budget**\n   - Keep an additive decode slack `slack_decode` (FrankenSQLite V1 uses `+2`).\n   - Add multiplicative overhead `overhead_percent` as needed.\n5. **Anytime-valid tuning**\n   - Use an anytime-valid monitor (e-process) to decide when to raise redundancy.\n   - Record changes in an evidence ledger.\n6. **Decode proofs**\n   - When tooling decodes/repairs, it emits a proof artifact describing which symbols were used and why the decode is trusted.\n\n### Concrete Formulas (From FrankenSQLite Spec Excerpts)\nThese are the “load-bearing” knobs we can reuse verbatim:\n\n- Additive slack:\n  - `slack_decode = 2` (default)\n\n- Repair symbol count selection:\n  - `R = max(slack_decode, ceil(K_source * overhead_percent / 100))`\n\n- Back-of-envelope loss fraction tolerated (engineering approximation):\n  - `loss_fraction_max ≈ max(0, (R - slack_decode) / (K_source + R))`\n\n### Deterministic Seed Derivation (Portable Rule)\nFrankenSQLite uses a deterministic seed derived from a stable identifier (e.g., changeset id):\n- `seed = xxh3_64(id_bytes)`\n\nglibc_rust mapping recommendation:\n- Define an `epoch_id` that is stable within-process (and includes a monotonic counter).\n- Derive seed from `(epoch_id || build_id || mode)` to avoid collisions across runs.\n\n### Record/Envelope Mapping (What We Emit)\nFrankenSQLite’s SymbolRecord idea maps cleanly to libc evidence:\n\n- **EvidenceSymbolRecord** (proposal)\n  - Header: `{ magic, version, epoch_id, seqno, family, mode, action, flags }`\n  - Coding: `{ esi, k_source, r_repair, symbol_size_T, seed }`\n  - Integrity: `{ payload_hash (xxh3_128 or blake3), prev_hash (hash-chain) }`\n  - Payload: fixed-size `T` bytes (small; e.g., 64–256B), or padded.\n\nNotes:\n- “Auth tags” are optional: for libc evidence we may just do hash-chains + optional MAC in tooling.\n- Source symbols should be cheap to write (memcpy into ring buffer + atomic seqno).\n- Repair symbols should be generated on cadence (every N decisions, timer tick, or on exit).\n\n### Where Decode Happens\n- Runtime: encode only (systematic always; repair optional).\n- Harness/tooling: decode, verify hashes/chain, emit DecodeProof.\n\n### Open Design Choice (Explicit)\nWe must choose whether runtime implements:\n- a small XOR-only fountain (LT-like) code (fastest, simplest), or\n- a tighter RaptorQ-compatible schedule (harder), or\n- “RaptorQ-inspired” parity that tooling decodes with a matching decoder.\n\nThis is decided in `bd-3a9`.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria For The Pattern Extraction\n- A concrete mapping of the above into glibc_rust terms (epoch, record format, seed, R selection).\n- Explicit non-goals: no GF(256) Gaussian solve on hot path; no asupersync runtime dep.\n- A minimal test matrix for future implementation:\n  - drop/bitflip simulation\n  - deterministic reproduction\n  - decode-proof verification","created_at":"2026-02-09T21:50:28Z"}]}

{"id":"bd-13zp","title":"EPIC: Killer Demo - Memory Safety Membrane Showcase","description":"Build a compelling, CI-executable demonstration that showcases FrankenLibC's core value proposition: the Transparent Safety Membrane detecting and repairing memory safety violations in real-time. The demo runs a known use-after-free sample program and shows three modes side by side: (1) glibc baseline — the UAF silently corrupts memory, program produces wrong output or crashes non-deterministically. (2) FrankenLibC strict mode — the UAF is detected by the generational arena (generation mismatch), logged to the evidence ledger with full context (allocation site, free site, use site, generation numbers), but the program continues with ABI-compatible behavior (same as glibc — the corruption happens but is observed and recorded). (3) FrankenLibC hardened mode — the UAF is detected, the corrupted pointer is quarantined, the TSM applies a repair action (return NULL with errno=EFAULT or return safe default), and the program continues safely with the repair logged to the evidence ledger. The demo produces: (a) Terminal output showing the three modes with color-coded annotations. (b) Evidence ledger dump showing the detection chain. (c) Performance comparison (strict overhead <20ns, hardened overhead <200ns). (d) The demo is a single 'cargo run --example killer_demo' command, CI-executable, deterministic output.

{"id":"bd-18qq.1","title":"Fault injection: adversarial pointer patterns","description":"Implement a structured fault injection framework for adversarial pointer patterns that exercise the TSM's pointer validation pipeline. Patterns to inject: (1) Use-after-free — allocate, free, use. Vary: delay between free and use (0, 1, 100, 10000 operations), allocation size (small/medium/large), arena (same arena reuse vs cross-arena). (2) Dangling pointer — allocate, create alias, free original, use alias. Test alias detection across: stack pointers, heap pointers, mmap'd regions. (3) Wild pointer — generate pointers outside any valid region: NULL+offset, stack-heap gap, kernel space, unaligned. (4) Double-free — free the same pointer twice with varying delays.

{"id":"bd-1d6e","title":"Seqlocks for configuration hot paths (section 14.9)","description":"Implement seqlocks (sequence locks) for configuration hot paths in FrankenLibC. A seqlock uses a sequence counter: writers increment before and after updating. Readers read the counter, read the data, read the counter again — if the counter changed or is odd, retry. Seqlocks are optimal when: writes are rare, reads are extremely frequent, and the data is small (fits in a few cache lines). Unlike RW locks, readers never block writers. Application to FrankenLibC: (1) Allocator tuning parameters — arena count, size-class boundaries, fragmentation thresholds. Read on every allocation decision, updated only by explicit reconfiguration. (2) TSM sensitivity thresholds — the boundary between 'safe' and 'suspicious' states. Read on every TSM check, updated only by policy changes. (3) Clock configuration — vDSO-style time source configuration. Read on every clock_gettime, updated only on clock source changes. (4) Locale state — the active locale affects string comparison, character classification. Read by every locale-sensitive function, updated only by setlocale. Implementation: SeqLock<T: Copy> — requires T to be Copy (readers may see partially-updated data and must be able to discard it). For non-Copy types, use SeqLockRef<T> with retry-on-torn-read semantics. Performance target: reader fast path <3ns (load seq, load data, load seq, compare). Writer: <10ns (store seq+1, store data, store seq+2, fence).\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\nSee `acceptance_criteria` field.","design":"**Alien CS Reference:** Section 14.9 of graveyard.

{"id":"bd-1wzq","title":"HTM fast-path for hot libc functions (section 4.2, Score 3.0)","description":"Implement Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM) fast-path for the hottest libc functions on Intel TSX-capable processors. Concept: Use Intel RTM (Restricted Transactional Memory) instructions (XBEGIN/XEND/XABORT) to speculatively execute hot functions without acquiring locks. If the transaction commits, the function executed atomically without any synchronization overhead. If the transaction aborts (due to conflict, capacity, or interrupt), fall back to the standard lock-based path. Target functions: (1) malloc/free — speculative allocation from thread-local cache without arena lock. If cache is sufficient, commit. If not, abort and take the slow path. (2) memcpy for small sizes (<256 bytes) — speculative copy that avoids cache-line locking overhead. (3) pthread_mutex_lock — speculative lock elision (execute the critical section transactionally, skip the lock entirely). Implementation: (a) Runtime CPUID check for RTM support. (b) Adaptive retry logic — track abort rate per call site. If abort rate > threshold (e.g., 30%), disable HTM for that site for a cooldown period. (c) Fallback path must be functionally identical to HTM path. (d) TSM integration — TSM validation must be idempotent (safe to re-execute on transaction retry). Caveat: Intel deprecated TSX on some SKUs. This is a performance opportunity on supported hardware, not a required feature.\n\n**Alien CS Reference:** Section 4.2 of the graveyard. HTM (Intel TSX / IBM POWER HTM) provides speculative lock elision. Key papers: Herlihy & Moss (1993) original HTM proposal; Intel TSX Programming Guide. The graveyard Score 3.0 reflects hardware deprecation risk but high payoff on supported SKUs.\n\n**Rust Implementation Guidance:**\n- Use core::arch::x86_64::{_xbegin, _xend, _xabort, _xtest} intrinsics behind #[cfg(target_feature = \"rtm\")].\n- Wrap in HtmFastPath<F: Fn() -> R> that encapsulates the speculative-try/fallback pattern.\n- Per-call-site abort counter: AtomicU32 with relaxed ordering, sampled every 64 invocations to amortize overhead.\n- Cooldown: exponential backoff (1ms, 2ms, 4ms, ... up to 1s) before re-enabling HTM at a disabled site.\n- All TSM state reads inside the transaction must be from immutable/const data to avoid transactional capacity aborts.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n1. HtmFastPath compiles on non-RTM targets as a no-op passthrough (zero overhead).\n2. On RTM-capable hardware, malloc fast-path commit rate >70% under low contention (1-4 threads).\n3. Abort rate tracking is correct: synthetic abort injection yields accurate per-site counters.\n4. Fallback path produces bit-identical results to HTM path for all inputs.\n5. Adaptive disable/re-enable logic verified by test that forces >30% abort rate, confirms disable, waits cooldown, confirms re-enable.\n6. All operations emit structured tracing: tracing::trace!(target: \"htm\", site, outcome, abort_reason).\n7. Benchmark: malloc/free microbenchmark shows >15% throughput improvement on RTM hardware vs lock-based baseline at 4+ threads.\n\n**Logging Requirements:**\n- Every HTM transaction attempt logs: call_site_id, attempt_number, outcome (commit/abort/fallback), abort_code (if abort).\n- Periodic (every 1000 ops) summary log: per-site commit rate, abort rate, disabled sites, cooldown remaining.\n- All logs use tracing crate with target = \"htm\" for filterable structured output.","acceptance_criteria":"## Acceptance Criteria\nImplementation must preserve all existing functionality and claims while adding deterministic verification coverage.\n\n### Mandatory Verification Gate\n- Comprehensive unit tests are required for all touched logic: positive, negative, adversarial, and regression.\n- Deterministic e2e scripts are required for all externally visible behavior in strict and hardened mode where relevant.\n- Structured logs are mandatory for unit/e2e runs with fields: `trace_id`, `mode`, `api_family`, `symbol`, `decision_path`, `healing_action`, `errno`, `latency_ns`, `artifact_refs`.\n- Closure evidence must include exact test commands, expected outputs/thresholds, and representative failure signatures.\n- CI must persist logs, diffs, and reports with deterministic naming and retention for replay/triage.\n- Tooling contract: deterministic orchestration/traceability uses `/dp/asupersync`, and deterministic diff/snapshot/TUI evidence uses `/dp/frankentui`.","notes":"### Mandatory Test/E2E Logging Checklist\n- Test command set is documented in bead notes before closure (unit + e2e + perf where applicable).\n- Expected output and pass/fail thresholds are documented per command.\n- Failure triage snippets are documented (top failure classes + where to inspect artifacts).\n- Evidence index entry links logs, parity diffs, and benchmark/proof artifacts.\n- Overload behavior logging is required when applicable: pressure signal, degradation mode, selected policy, guard decision, rollback trigger.","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-13T09:28:22.229938007Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-13T23:06:12.722337726Z","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0}

(4) System Proofs — generational arena UAF impossibility, TSM pipeline termination, mode transition correctness.

FrankenLibC's safety architecture is organized as a sheaf over the 'topology of subsystems': each subsystem (allocator, string ops, stdio, threading) has local safety invariants, and the sheaf structure ensures they compose correctly on overlaps. Formal statement: Let F be the safety sheaf over the open cover U = {U_allocator, U_string, U_stdio, U_thread, ...} of the symbol space. For each U_i, F(U_i) is the set of local safety predicates. The sheaf condition requires: (1) Locality — if two global safety states agree on every local restriction, they are equal. (2) Gluing — if local safety states on overlapping subsystems are compatible (agree on the overlap), they can be glued into a unique global safety state. Prove: (a) The safety predicates form a sheaf (not just a presheaf) — the gluing axiom holds. (b) The Cech cohomology H^1(U, F) = 0 — there are no 'cohomological obstructions' to gluing local safety into global safety.

{"id":"bd-27uz","title":"Liquid Types for bounds checking at compile time (section 5.5, Score 2.0)","description":"Explore Liquid Types (refinement types with SMT-decidable predicates) for compile-time bounds checking in FrankenLibC. Liquid Types extend Rust's type system with logical predicates: instead of usize, write {v: usize | v < buf.len} to statically prove bounds safety. Application to FrankenLibC: (1) Buffer operations — memcpy(dst, src, n) requires {n: usize | n <= dst.len && n <= src.len}. Currently checked at runtime by TSM. With Liquid Types, the check happens at compile time — zero runtime overhead. (2) Array indexing — all internal array accesses in the allocator annotated with bounds predicates. (3) Size-class mapping — {size: usize | valid_size_class(size)} ensures only valid sizes reach the allocator. Implementation path: (a) Use Flux (Liquid Types for Rust, UC San Diego) or manual encoding via Rust's type system (newtype wrappers with invariants). (b) Start with the allocator's internal operations (highest safety value). (c) Extend to string operations (strlen, strncpy bounds). (d) Measure: how many runtime TSM checks can be eliminated by compile-time Liquid Type proofs? Target: eliminate 30% of runtime bounds checks.\n\n**Alien CS Reference:** Section 5.5 of the graveyard (Score 2.0). Liquid Types originated from Rondon, Kawaguchi, Jhala (PLDI 2008). Flux is the Rust-native implementation from UC San Diego. The low score reflects tooling immaturity but high theoretical value for eliminating runtime checks entirely.\n\n**Rust Implementation Guidance:**\n- Phase 1: Manual encoding via newtype wrappers: struct BoundedIndex<const MAX: usize>(usize) with TryFrom that enforces the bound. Use in allocator internals.\n- Phase 2: Explore Flux annotations (#[flux::sig(fn(n: usize{n < MAX}) -> ...)]) on allocator hot paths.\n- Phase 3: Measure TSM check elimination rate — count runtime checks before/after Liquid Type annotations.\n- All newtype wrappers must be #[repr(transparent)] for zero-cost ABI compatibility.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n1. BoundedIndex<N> newtype implemented with TryFrom<usize> and compile-time const-generic enforcement.\n2. At least 5 allocator-internal array accesses converted to use BoundedIndex, eliminating runtime bounds checks.\n3. BoundsAudit report generated at build time listing: total bounds checks, statically proven, dynamically checked.\n4.

{"id":"bd-29j3","title":"Elimination Backoff for stack/queue optimization (section 14.11)","description":"Implement elimination backoff for concurrent stack and queue operations in FrankenLibC. Elimination backoff is a scalability technique for concurrent data structures where complementary operations (push/pop for stacks, enqueue/dequeue for queues) can eliminate each other without accessing the shared data structure. When a push and pop arrive concurrently, they exchange values directly through a collision array, bypassing the contention on the stack/queue head. Application to FrankenLibC: (1) Free-list management — in the allocator, free() (push to free list) and malloc() (pop from free list) can eliminate each other. When a thread frees a block while another thread is allocating the same size class, the block transfers directly between threads without touching the shared free list. (2) Deferred free queue — in hardened mode, quarantined blocks are queued for deferred freeing. Elimination backoff reduces contention on the quarantine queue. Implementation: (a) EliminationArray<T> — array of exchanger slots. Each thread selects a random slot and waits briefly for a complementary operation. (b) Adaptive backoff — if elimination succeeds frequently, use it more. If not, fall back to the shared data structure. (c) Thread-local slot affinity — each thread prefers its own slot to reduce collisions.\n\n**Alien CS Reference:** Section 14.11 of the graveyard. Elimination backoff from Hendler, Shavit, Yerushalmi (SPAA 2004). Combines with Treiber stack (1986) and Michael-Scott queue (1996). The key insight is that complementary operations cancel out, reducing contention to zero for matched pairs.\n\n**Rust Implementation Guidance:**\n- EliminationArray<T, const SLOTS: usize> backed by an array of AtomicPtr<ExchangeSlot<T>>.\n- Each ExchangeSlot: enum { Empty, Offer(T), Taken }. Use compare_exchange with AcqRel ordering.\n- Timeout: each thread spins for at most SPIN_LIMIT (e.g., 128 iterations) before falling back to the shared structure.\n- Thread-local slot affinity via thread_local! slot_hint: usize, incremented on each collision for jitter.\n- Adaptive elimination: track success rate in AtomicU64 counter, disable elimination when success_rate < 10% over last 1000 ops.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n1. EliminationArray<T, N> compiles and passes miri for basic push/pop exchange.\n2. Free-list integration: malloc/free elimination path active when both operate on same size class concurrently.\n3. Elimination success rate >30% under 8-thread symmetric malloc/free workload (each thread alternates malloc/free of same size).\n4. Adaptive disable works: when only malloc (or only free) is running, elimination disabled within 1000 ops, no performance regression vs baseline.\n5.

Ubuntu you can build individual packages but much trickier to do for all downstream dependencies.\"\n> \"Codex should be able to set up a stage 3 docker container that can build…say the top 100 C/C++ Gentoo packages.\"\n\nThis is the definitive validation that FrankenLibC works across the C/C++ ecosystem. If we can LD_PRELOAD FrankenLibC and successfully build+test the top 100+ Gentoo packages, we have proof that the membrane handles real-world code patterns.\n\n# Key Insights from the Conversation\n\n1. **Gentoo's Unique Advantage**: Unlike binary distros, Gentoo compiles everything from source with full control over CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, and LD_PRELOAD. Perfect for our interposition strategy.\n\n2. **LLVM libc Partial Overlay**: @joelcompiles mentioned \"LLVM's libc...the ability to do a partial overlay that uses part libc / part system C stdlib\". This is exactly our L1/L2 graduation model.\n\n3. **Validation Scope**: Top 100 C/C++ packages = comprehensive coverage of allocation patterns, string operations, threading models, signal handling, etc.\n\n# Success Criteria\n\n- Stage 3 Docker environment running with FrankenLibC LD_PRELOAD\n- Top 100 C/C++ packages build successfully\n- Test suites pass (or failures are documented with root cause)\n- Performance overhead documented per-package\n- Security healing actions logged and verified\n- Zero regressions in FrankenLibC itself\n\n# Strategic Value\n\nThis validates our claim: \"If you're willing to absorb an extra <200ns per call, we can transform any code into safe code.\" Gentoo validation proves this at ecosystem scale.","acceptance_criteria":"## Success Criteria\n\n### Mandatory Verification Gate\n1.

Integration + E2E Evidence\n- Add or extend fixture-driven integration coverage in `tests/conformance` and/or `tests/integration` for this bead scope.\n- Add a deterministic E2E script path (or harness command) with explicit setup/teardown and replayable seeds.\n- Compare FrankenLibC outputs against host glibc fixtures (or documented replacement-level contract) for all touched symbols.\n\n3. Logging + Traceability Evidence\n- Emit structured logs (JSONL or deterministic text) that include bead ID, scenario ID, runtime mode, symbol family, decision path, and outcome.\n- Verify logs expose repair/deny counters and reason codes so regressions are diagnosable from artifacts alone.\n- Record artifact paths in bead notes (test logs, fixture diffs, benchmark outputs, conformance reports).\n\n4.

Unit Test Evidence\n- Add deterministic unit tests for nominal, boundary, and invalid-input paths in the touched modules.\n- Include strict and hardened mode assertions when behavior differs by runtime mode.\n- Include failure-mode tests covering repair/deny/default behavior with explicit expected outputs.\n\n2. Integration + E2E Evidence\n- Add or extend fixture-driven integration coverage in `tests/conformance` and/or `tests/integration` for this bead scope.\n- Add a deterministic E2E script path (or harness command) with explicit setup/teardown and replayable seeds.\n- Compare FrankenLibC outputs against host glibc fixtures (or documented replacement-level contract) for all touched symbols.\n\n3. Logging + Traceability Evidence\n- Emit structured logs (JSONL or deterministic text) that include bead ID, scenario ID, runtime mode, symbol family, decision path, and outcome.\n- Verify logs expose repair/deny counters and reason codes so regressions are diagnosable from artifacts alone.\n- Record artifact paths in bead notes (test logs, fixture diffs, benchmark outputs, conformance reports).\n\n4. Performance + Regression Evidence\n- Capture before/after baseline for latency/throughput on touched hot paths.\n- Enforce no-regression threshold or document bounded tradeoff with quantitative rationale.\n\n5. CI Gate Evidence\n- `cargo fmt --check`\n- `cargo check --all-targets`\n- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`\n- `cargo test --all-targets`\n- all bead-specific harness and E2E scripts pass with deterministic logs archived.","notes":"## Mandatory Test/E2E Logging Checklist\n- [ ] Unit tests added/updated for happy-path, edge-case, and invalid-input behavior.\n- [ ] Property-style or fuzz-seed replay coverage added where state space is large/combinatorial.\n- [ ] Integration fixtures added/updated in `tests/conformance` and validated against host glibc expectations.\n- [ ] Deterministic E2E script/runner added or updated with explicit command lines and seed controls.\n- [ ] Strict vs hardened behavior assertions are explicit and versioned in fixtures.\n- [ ] Structured logs include: timestamp, bead ID, test scenario, runtime mode, symbol family, decision path, action (allow/repair/deny), and result.\n- [ ] Failure logs include reason codes + minimal reproducible input payload metadata.\n- [ ] Benchmark/perf logs include baseline, candidate, delta %, and pass/fail gate decision.\n- [ ] CI artifacts include conformance report, E2E transcript, and summarized pass/fail matrix.\n- [ ] Release/merge gate blocked if any required test or log artifact is missing.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-13T01:51:10.949547113Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-14T04:17:09.731656760Z","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-2icq.16","depends_on_id":"bd-2icq","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-13T01:51:10.949547113Z","created_by":"ubuntu","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""},{"issue_id":"bd-2icq.16","depends_on_id":"bd-2icq.11","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-13T01:52:32.837153646Z","created_by":"ubuntu","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""},{"issue_id":"bd-2icq.16","depends_on_id":"bd-2icq.12","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-13T03:18:25.123914196Z","created_by":"ubuntu","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""}]}

Logging + Traceability Evidence\n- Emit structured logs (JSONL or deterministic text) that include bead ID, scenario ID, runtime mode, symbol family, decision path, and outcome.\n- Verify logs expose repair/deny counters and reason codes so regressions are diagnosable from artifacts alone.\n- Record artifact paths in bead notes (test logs, fixture diffs, benchmark outputs, conformance reports).\n\n4.

{"id":"bd-2uju","title":"PCC at FFI boundary (section 11.9, Score 3.0)","description":"Implement Proof-Carrying Code (PCC) at the FFI boundary between FrankenLibC and calling programs. PCC attaches a machine-checkable proof to code that crosses a trust boundary. For FrankenLibC, the FFI boundary is where untrusted C code calls into the libc. PCC can prove: (1) Calling convention compliance — the caller has set up the stack frame, registers, and arguments correctly according to the System V ABI. (2) Pointer validity — pointer arguments passed to libc functions point to valid, accessible memory regions. (3) Size consistency — buffer size arguments match actual buffer sizes. Implementation: (a) At the FFI entry point, the PCC verifier checks the proof attached to the call. If the proof verifies, skip TSM runtime checks (they are proven unnecessary). If no proof or invalid proof, fall through to full TSM validation. (b) Proof generation: the calling program's compiler (or a post-compilation pass) generates proofs for each libc call site. (c) Proof format: use a compact proof representation (e.g., Foundational PCC with LF type theory). (d) Performance target: proof verification <5ns (faster than full TSM validation at 20ns). Net effect: PCC-verified call sites get near-zero overhead, unverified call sites get full TSM protection.\n\n**Alien CS Reference:** Section 11.9 of the graveyard (Score 3.0). PCC originated from Necula (1997). Foundational PCC (Appel & Felten 2001) uses LF type theory for compact proofs. The pattern maps to FrankenLibC's FFI trust boundary where untrusted C code enters the libc.\n\n**Rust Implementation Guidance:**\n- Define ProofToken as an opaque ZST (zero-sized type) constructed only by the PCC verifier.\n- FFI entry points check thread-local Option<ProofToken> (not ABI-visible parameter) for backward compatibility.\n- Proof format: minimal bytecode verified by a stack-based checker in <5ns.\n- PccVerifier struct with verify(proof_bytes: &[u8], call_site: CallSiteDescriptor) -> Option<ProofToken>.\n- If proof verification fails or no proof present, full TSM validation runs (graceful degradation).\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n1. PccVerifier implemented with stack-based proof checker supporting: pointer-in-bounds, size-matches-allocation, alignment-correct proof obligations.\n2. Proof verification latency <5ns for simple proofs (stack buffer with known size) measured by criterion.\n3. At least 3 FFI entry points (memcpy, snprintf, malloc) instrumented with PCC fast-path.\n4. When proof present and valid: TSM validation is skipped, measurable latency reduction (>10ns savings).\n5. When proof absent or invalid: full TSM validation runs, no behavior change vs current (regression test).\n6. Proof format specification document committed to docs/pcc_proof_format.md.\n7. Evidence ledger records PCC decisions: call_site, proof_present, proof_valid, action (fast_path or full_tsm).\n\n**Logging Requirements:**\n- Every PCC verification: call_site, proof_size_bytes, verification_result, verification_time_ns via tracing::debug!(target: \"pcc\").\n- Periodic summary (every 10K calls): PCC hit rate, average verification time, TSM bypass count.\n- Proof failures at WARN level with truncated proof bytes for debugging.","acceptance_criteria":"## Acceptance Criteria\nImplementation must preserve all existing functionality and claims while adding deterministic verification coverage.\n\n### Mandatory Verification Gate\n- Comprehensive unit tests are required for all touched logic: positive, negative, adversarial, and regression.\n- Deterministic e2e scripts are required for all externally visible behavior in strict and hardened mode where relevant.\n- Structured logs are mandatory for unit/e2e runs with fields: `trace_id`, `mode`, `api_family`, `symbol`, `decision_path`, `healing_action`, `errno`, `latency_ns`, `artifact_refs`.\n- Closure evidence must include exact test commands, expected outputs/thresholds, and representative failure signatures.\n- CI must persist logs, diffs, and reports with deterministic naming and retention for replay/triage.\n- Tooling contract: deterministic orchestration/traceability uses `/dp/asupersync`, and deterministic diff/snapshot/TUI evidence uses `/dp/frankentui`.","notes":"### Mandatory Test/E2E Logging Checklist\n- Test command set is documented in bead notes before closure (unit + e2e + perf where applicable).\n- Expected output and pass/fail thresholds are documented per command.\n- Failure triage snippets are documented (top failure classes + where to inspect artifacts).\n- Evidence index entry links logs, parity diffs, and benchmark/proof artifacts.\n- Overload behavior logging is required when applicable: pressure signal, degradation mode, selected policy, guard decision, rollback trigger.","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-13T09:28:57.024281179Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-13T23:06:12.316197517Z","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"comments":[{"id":316,"issue_id":"bd-2uju","author":"Dicklesworthstone","text":"Card 2 (PCC FFI fast-path) applies; verifier budget <=5ns and invalid-proof auto-disable trigger required.","created_at":"2026-02-13T22:28:48Z"}]}

Full POSIX coverage target with GNU compatibility where expected by real software.\n2. ABI compatibility is mandatory (symbols, versions, calling conventions, errno behavior).\n3. Runtime mode switch is mandatory: `FRANKENLIBC_MODE=strict|hardened` (default `strict`), process-level, immutable after init.\n4. Clean-room porting: spec-first; never line-by-line translate legacy glibc.\n5. `/dp/asupersync` and `/dp/frankentui` are mandatory build/test tooling (NOT runtime libc deps).\n6. Mandatory methods:\n   - alien-artifact-coding: formal / lattice / evidence / guarantees; but compiled to simple runtime artifacts.\n   - extreme-software-optimization: profile-first; behavior proofs; one lever per change.\n\n## Replacement Levels (What “Finished” Means)\nReplacement level definitions and artifacts are part of the release contract:\n- L0 (Interpose): `LD_PRELOAD` on host glibc; allowed taxonomy includes `GlibcCallThrough` and `Stub`.\n- L1 (Hardened Interpose): L0 but hardened is the default runtime mode; hard-parts and evidence gates become stricter.\n- L2 (Partial Replace): no host glibc required for a declared subset of programs/surfaces; CRT/syscall glue and core pthread primitives are required.\n- L3 (Full Replace): no host glibc required for general dynamic programs; rtld/loader hard-parts must be real.\n\nCurrent claim (see README + `tests/conformance/replacement_levels.json`): L0.\n\n## Mode Contract (Strict vs Hardened)\nStrict mode:\n- objective: maximize ABI-compatible observational equivalence on defined inputs.\n- repairs are NOT admissible; invalid/undefined inputs must not be “helpfully rewritten”.\n\nHardened mode:\n- objective: prevent memory-unsafe outcomes via deterministic repair/deny actions.\n- every repair/deny path must emit auditable evidence.\n\nMode selection must be deterministic and immutable for the process lifetime.\n\n## TSM Contract (Transparent Safety Membrane)\nThe ABI boundary is treated as an untrusted input surface.\nEvery entrypoint performs mode-aware validation and then routes:\n`ABI -> membrane (validate/sanitize/repair/audit) -> core (safe kernels) | raw syscalls | controlled callthrough (L0 only)`.\n\nTSM pipeline is explicitly performance-budgeted:\n- strict overhead target: <20ns/call for membrane-gated hot paths\n- hardened overhead target: <200ns/call for membrane-gated hot paths\n\n## Evidence-Driven Completion (What Closes Beads)\nNo feature is “done” without:\n- fixture-based conformance evidence (strict + hardened where relevant),\n- benchmark evidence (baseline + delta; plus isomorphism/behavior proof for optimizations),\n- deterministic E2E coverage for representative real programs (LD_PRELOAD smoke/stress/fault/stability),\n- structured logs that are joinable across artifacts (trace_id, mode, gate, symbol/api_family, outcome, timing, artifact refs).\n\nThe closure program is centered around:\n- `bd-5fw`: release-exit contract + deterministic closure protocol.\n- `bd-33p`: evidence/logging unification and compliance gates.\n- `bd-b5a`: deterministic E2E suite.\n- `bd-15n` + `bd-2tq`: conformance expansion and POSIX suite.\n- `bd-30o`: optimization closure with proofs.\n- `bd-29b`: runtime config/env truth and drift prevention.\n\n## Phase Map (From PLAN_TO_PORT_GLIBC_TO_RUST.md, but Self-Contained Here)\nThis is the canonical phase model for the port, expressed as bead workstreams:\n\nPhase 0: Spec Lock + Scope Matrix\n- Deliver: explicit scope ledger (what we claim), strict/hardened semantics per family, and traceability anchors.\n- Evidence: matrix rows for critique beads;

Motivation: The read-heavy metadata path is a persistent performance hotspot in profiling. Thread metadata (thread ID, stack bounds, TLS base, arena assignment, size-class cache) is read on every allocation and free but written rarely (only on thread creation/destruction or arena rebalancing). Current implementation uses mutex-based access which creates unnecessary contention on read-heavy paths. QSBR RCU provides: (1) Zero-overhead reads — no atomic operations, no memory barriers on the read path. Readers simply access the current version of metadata directly. (2) Safe reclamation — writers create a new version, publish it via atomic pointer swap, then wait for all readers to pass through a quiescent state before freeing the old version. (3) Uses: thread metadata structs, allocation size-class tables (read on every malloc to determine which size class), TLS cache entries. Implementation: QSBR is ideal because libc controls the quiescent state boundaries — every syscall return and every allocation entry/exit is a natural quiescent point.

{"id":"bd-3een","title":"LCRQ ring queues for IPC (section 14.6)","description":"Implement LCRQ (Linked Concurrent Ring Queue) for high-performance inter-process communication in FrankenLibC. LCRQ combines the cache-friendliness of ring buffers with the unbounded capacity of linked lists. Structure: a linked list of fixed-size ring segments. Each segment is a cache-line-aligned array with head/tail indices using FAA (Fetch-And-Add) for O(1) enqueue/dequeue. When a segment fills, a new one is linked. Application to FrankenLibC: (1) Evidence ledger IPC — when the evidence ledger runs in a separate process (for crash isolation), LCRQ provides the high-throughput, low-latency communication channel. Target: >10M events/sec with <100ns per-event latency. (2) Deferred free IPC — in hardened mode, freed blocks may be sent to a separate quarantine manager process. LCRQ handles the transfer without blocking the application thread. (3) Metric export — real-time allocation statistics exported to monitoring via LCRQ. Implementation: (a) LcrqSegment<T, N> — ring buffer of N slots. (b) Lcrq<T, N> — linked list of segments with hazard-pointer-based reclamation for consumed segments. (c) Shared memory support — LCRQ must work across processes via mmap'd shared memory (all pointers must be offset-based, not absolute). (d) Backpressure — when the consumer falls behind, the producer sees a full queue and applies configurable backpressure (block, drop, or signal).\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\nSee `acceptance_criteria` field.","design":"**Alien CS Reference:** Section 14.6 of graveyard.

The contract specifies: (1) State definitions — Safe: all TSM checks pass, no anomalies detected. Suspicious: one or more soft anomalies (e.g., unusual allocation pattern, pointer near boundary). Unsafe: hard violation detected (UAF, double-free, buffer overflow). (2) Transition rules — Safe->Suspicious: any soft anomaly. Suspicious->Unsafe: hard violation OR timeout in suspicious state. Suspicious->Safe: all checks pass for N consecutive operations. Unsafe->Safe: only via explicit repair in hardened mode. (3) Mode behavior — Strict: observe and log all transitions but never modify behavior. Report violations via evidence ledger. Hardened: actively intervene at Suspicious (increase monitoring) and Unsafe (quarantine + repair). (4) Contract enforcement — the decision contract is a state machine encoded as a const array of (state, event, next_state, action) tuples. The TSM evaluates this table on every operation.

{"id":"bd-3jzb","title":"BRAVO RW Locks for read-heavy paths (section 14.7)","description":"Implement BRAVO (Biased Reader And Visible Observer) reader-writer locks for read-heavy paths in FrankenLibC. BRAVO is a RW lock optimized for the common case of read-dominant workloads. Readers use a visible-reader protocol (write their TID to a shared slot on read entry, clear on exit). Writers check all slots for active readers. Key innovation: biased locking — the fast path for readers is a single atomic write (no CAS, no fence on x86-TSO). Writers pay the cost of scanning reader slots. Application to FrankenLibC: (1) Allocation metadata — the per-arena metadata (free list head, allocation count, generation counters) is read on every allocation for validation but written infrequently (only on actual alloc/free state changes). BRAVO eliminates reader contention. (2) TSM certificate cache — evaluated certificates are cached. Cache reads vastly outnumber writes (cache invalidation is rare). (3) Thread registry — the list of active threads is read by garbage collection and RCU grace period detection but modified only on thread creation/destruction. Performance target: reader fast path <5ns (single atomic store), writer path <100ns (slot scan + fence). Comparison: implement alongside RCU (bd-3aof) and Left-Right (bd-cs9w) — benchmark all three for FrankenLibC's specific read/write ratios to determine which is optimal for each use case.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\nSee `acceptance_criteria` field.","design":"**Alien CS Reference:** Section 14.7 of graveyard.

Separation Logic extends Hoare Logic with spatial connectives (separating conjunction *, magic wand -*) that reason about heap-manipulating programs. For FrankenLibC, Separation Logic can prove: (1) Frame rule — TSM validation does not modify any memory outside its own bookkeeping region. Formally: {P * F} tsm_validate(ptr) {Q * F} — the frame F (all memory not accessed by TSM) is preserved. (2) Ownership transfer — when malloc returns a pointer, ownership transfers from the arena to the caller. When free is called, ownership transfers back. The generational arena's generation check is a runtime enforcement of the separation logic ownership discipline. (3) No-overlap — allocated regions do not overlap. Formally: {ptr1 |-> v1 * ptr2 |-> v2} implies ptr1 != ptr2. Implementation: (a) Annotate TSM functions with separation logic pre/post conditions as structured comments. (b) Use Prusti or Creusot (Rust verification tools) to mechanically check a subset. (c) Document which annotations are mechanically verified vs manually reviewed. Target: annotate all TSM entry points (validate_pointer, check_bounds, generation_check, quarantine_enter, repair_apply).\n\n**Alien CS Reference:** Section 5.8 of the graveyard (Score 3.0).

For Rust: Prusti uses Viper backend, Creusot uses Why3.\n\n**Rust Implementation Guidance:**\n- Define annotation macros: separation_logic_pre!/separation_logic_post! as structured doc comments parseable by external tools.\n- For Prusti: use #[requires(...)] and #[ensures(...)] attributes on TSM functions.\n- For Creusot: use #[creusot::requires(...)] with WhyML backend.\n- Create separation_logic_audit.py CI script that extracts all annotations and verifies coverage.\n- All unsafe blocks within annotated functions must have SAFETY comments referencing the separation logic justification.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n1. All 5 TSM entry points annotated with separation logic pre/post conditions.\n2. At least 2 annotations mechanically verified by Prusti or Creusot (document which tool and any limitations).\n3. Frame rule proven for tsm_validate: TSM does not modify caller-visible memory.\n4. Ownership transfer annotations for malloc/free lifecycle: arena_owns(ptr) -> caller_owns(ptr) -> arena_owns(ptr).\n5. separation_logic_audit.py runs in CI: reports annotated count, mechanically verified count, coverage percent.\n6. Documentation committed to docs/separation_logic_annotations.md.\n7. Unannotated TSM functions cause CI warning.\n\n**Logging Requirements:**\n- CI audit outputs structured JSON: {annotated: N, verified_mechanical: M, verified_manual: K, coverage_pct: P}.\n- Any unannotated TSM function triggers CI warning with function name and file location.","acceptance_criteria":"## Acceptance Criteria\nImplementation must preserve all existing functionality and claims while adding deterministic verification coverage.\n\n### Mandatory Verification Gate\n- Comprehensive unit tests are required for all touched logic: positive, negative, adversarial, and regression.\n- Deterministic e2e scripts are required for all externally visible behavior in strict and hardened mode where relevant.\n- Structured logs are mandatory for unit/e2e runs with fields: `trace_id`, `mode`, `api_family`, `symbol`, `decision_path`, `healing_action`, `errno`, `latency_ns`, `artifact_refs`.\n- Closure evidence must include exact test commands, expected outputs/thresholds, and representative failure signatures.\n- CI must persist logs, diffs, and reports with deterministic naming and retention for replay/triage.\n- Tooling contract: deterministic orchestration/traceability uses `/dp/asupersync`, and deterministic diff/snapshot/TUI evidence uses `/dp/frankentui`.","notes":"### Mandatory Test/E2E Logging Checklist\n- Test command set is documented in bead notes before closure (unit + e2e + perf where applicable).\n- Expected output and pass/fail thresholds are documented per command.\n- Failure triage snippets are documented (top failure classes + where to inspect artifacts).\n- Evidence index entry links logs, parity diffs, and benchmark/proof artifacts.\n- Overload behavior logging is required when applicable: pressure signal, degradation mode, selected policy, guard decision, rollback trigger.","status":"in_progress","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"WildPlateau","created_at":"2026-02-13T09:28:34.502446719Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-15T02:22:40.593960620Z","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"comments":[{"id":343,"issue_id":"bd-3ohk","author":"WildPlateau","text":"Progress update (bd-3ohk): implemented separation-logic annotation scaffold + deterministic audit gate.\n\nChanges landed:\n- Added structured separation-logic tags (, , , ) on 5 mapped TSM entrypoints:\n  -

HA1zgq_bcAANvqo.jpeg is fundamentally correct as a quality bar:\n1) it must compile and run as a complete unit (not just compile)\n2) it must not secretly rely on system glibc for the hard parts if we claim replacement\n3) TODO stubs cannot exist in the core surface area we claim is implemented\n4) hardest subsystems (loader/startup/NSS/locale/resolv/threading/TLS) need an explicit phased plan\n5) advanced math must be either (a) directly tied to real runtime decisions with evidence+benchmarks, or (b) gated as research.\n\nDeliverable: a bead graph that closes every critique line item with objective evidence (E2E tests, ABI diffs, parity matrix, perf budgets, and proof artifacts).\n\nDefinition of done:\n- E2E LD_PRELOAD smoke suite passes on real programs.\n- Support matrix explicitly marks each API as implemented vs syscall vs glibc-callthrough vs stub.\n- Strict/hardened modes have explicit semantics and perf budgets, enforced by benches.\n- runtime_math is either justified (measured, used) or moved behind opt-in research feature.\n\nVerification Mandate:\n- Every implementation child bead MUST ship comprehensive unit tests and deterministic e2e scripts (strict + hardened where applicable).\n- Every test/e2e execution MUST emit detailed structured logs (trace_id, mode, symbol/API family, decision path, errno/outcome, timing, and artifact pointers).\n- No bead may close without: test commands, expected outputs, and failure-log artifact examples documented in bead notes or linked reports.\n\nEvidence & Test Requirements:\n- Add comprehensive unit tests

{"id":"bd-byd9","title":"EPIC: Flat Combining for Contended State [Score 6.0, section 14.2]","description":"Implement flat combining for sequentially batching operations under contention. When multiple threads contend on shared state (e.g., global allocation statistics, arena rebalancing counters, evidence ledger writes), flat combining designates one thread as the 'combiner' that executes all pending operations sequentially, eliminating lock contention. How it works: (1) Each thread publishes its pending operation to a per-thread slot in a shared publication list. (2) One thread acquires the combiner lock. (3) The combiner scans all publication slots, collects pending operations, and executes them all sequentially. (4) The combiner writes results back to each thread's slot. (5) Other threads spin-wait on their slot until the result appears. Benefits: (a) Sequential execution eliminates all synchronization within the combined batch. (b) Cache locality — the combiner's working set stays hot. (c) Throughput scales better than lock-based approaches under high contention because the combiner amortizes lock acquisition cost across N operations.

Each slot contains: operation (Option<Op>), result (Option<Result>), active flag, age counter. (2) CombinerLock — a simple test-and-set lock. Only the combiner holds it. (3) combine() method — acquires lock, scans publication list, executes all pending ops on shared state T, writes results back, releases lock. (4) apply(op: Op) -> Result — publish op to thread's slot, try to become combiner. If successful, run combine(). If not, spin-wait on slot until result appears. First application: global allocation statistics (total_allocated, total_freed, active_allocations, peak_usage, per-size-class counts). Currently protected by a Mutex<AllocStats>. Under 32-thread workload, this mutex is a top-5 contention point. Flat combining should reduce contention by 10-50x for stat-heavy workloads (e.g., mallinfo called frequently).\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\nSee `acceptance_criteria` field.","design":"**Alien CS Reference:** Section 14.2 of graveyard (Score 6.0).

Left-Right maintains two copies of the data structure (left and right). Readers always access one copy wait-free (no locks, no atomics on the read path).

Compared to RCU (bd-3aof), Left-Right provides: (a) Wait-free reads (not just lock-free). (b) Works for non-RCU-friendly data structures (those requiring consistent snapshots of multiple fields). Application to FrankenLibC: (1) Allocator configuration — the allocator's configuration (size-class table, arena count, thread-to-arena mapping) is a complex multi-field structure that must be read consistently. Left-Right provides atomic snapshot reads without locks. (2) TSM policy table — the TSM's decision policy (state machine transitions, threshold parameters) may be updated at runtime (e.g., when switching from strict to hardened mode). Left-Right ensures readers always see a consistent policy snapshot. (3) Symbol dispatch table — the IFUNC-like dispatch table mapping symbols to implementations.

Any divergence is a conformance failure. (3) Traceability — link each fixture to its ABI family (string, stdio, stdlib, math, pthread, etc.) and POSIX specification section. (4) Healing Oracle — for each symbol in hardened mode, verify that the TSM detects the injected fault and produces a correct repair (quarantine for UAF, safe default for invalid input, etc.). (5) Benchmark Gate — verify strict mode meets <20ns overhead target and hardened mode meets <200ns overhead target per symbol invocation.

work amortized\n  - may run in a background worker thread only in hardened mode\n- Export:\n  - tooling/harness reads the ring (or a frozen snapshot) and performs decode + proof.\n\n### Reliability Model\nWe model losses as:\n- erasures: records not present (ring overwrite, sampling drop, partial capture)\n- corruption: payload hash mismatch (bit flips, races)\n\nWe treat corruption as “erase and try to repair” (don’t let bad bytes poison decode).\n\n### Adaptive Redundancy (Control)\n- Observe: loss rate (erasures) and corruption rate in exported traces.\n- Decide: raise redundancy when anytime-valid evidence says we’re violating durability/observability budgets.\n- Act: increase `R` (repair symbols) in future epochs; optionally retro-harden recent epochs.\n\nThis is implemented via `bd-284` and wired to runtime_math e-process + evidence ledger.\n\n### Deliverables / Done Means\n- Encoding path exists with strict-mode overhead indistinguishable from baseline.\n- Offline decode exists and verifies record integrity + hash-chain.\n- Loss/corruption simulation tests demonstrate reconstruction up to documented budgets.\n- Evidence reports are explainable: when repair happens, tooling emits a DecodeProof.","created_at":"2026-02-09T21:50:51Z"},{"id":60,"issue_id":"bd-wuh","author":"Dicklesworthstone","text":"EPIC COMPLETE.
