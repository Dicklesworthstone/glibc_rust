When something bad happens we want an *audit-grade* trail that survives partial loss (ring-buffer overwrites, sampling, crashes, dropped events) and remains explainable.\n\nRaptorQ's key “alien artifact” idea is **appendable redundancy**:\n- emit cheap *systematic* symbols first (fast path)\n- optionally emit deterministic *repair* symbols later (background cadence)\n- decode and generate proofs offline (harness/tooling), not on the hot path\n\n### Constraints (glibc_rust-specific)\n- No `/dp/asupersync` runtime dependency. Runtime may implement a tiny encoder itself.\n- Strict mode must not pay codec costs on the hot path.\n- Hardened mode may pay bounded overhead but must remain deterministic and measurable.\n\n### Portable Pattern (What We Copy)\n1. **Source block / epoching**\n   - Group a bounded window of evidence events into an *epoch*.\n   - Epoch defines: `K_source` (number of systematic records), `T` (record/symbol size), and seed.\n2. **Systematic fast path**\n   - Emit/store raw evidence records as systematic symbols `ESI = 0..K_source-1`.\n   - Layout should favor sequential capture/export (contiguous run) to minimize read overhead in tooling.\n3. **Deterministic repair generation**\n   - Generate repair symbols `ESI = K_source..K_source+R-1` deterministically from `(epoch_id, K_source, T, policy)`.\n   - Determinism is the superpower: tooling can reproduce encoding schedule and validate.\n4. **Overhead = additive slack + multiplicative budget**\n   - Keep an additive decode slack `slack_decode` (FrankenSQLite V1 uses `+2`).\n   - Add multiplicative overhead `overhead_percent` as needed.\n5. **Anytime-valid tuning**\n   - Use an anytime-valid monitor (e-process) to decide when to raise redundancy.\n   - Record changes in an evidence ledger.\n6. **Decode proofs**\n   - When tooling decodes/repairs, it emits a proof artifact describing which symbols were used and why the decode is trusted.\n\n### Concrete Formulas (From FrankenSQLite Spec Excerpts)\nThese are the “load-bearing” knobs we can reuse verbatim:\n\n- Additive slack:\n  - `slack_decode = 2` (default)\n\n- Repair symbol count selection:\n  - `R = max(slack_decode, ceil(K_source * overhead_percent / 100))`\n\n- Back-of-envelope loss fraction tolerated (engineering approximation):\n  - `loss_fraction_max ≈ max(0, (R - slack_decode) / (K_source + R))`\n\n### Deterministic Seed Derivation (Portable Rule)\nFrankenSQLite uses a deterministic seed derived from a stable identifier (e.g., changeset id):\n- `seed = xxh3_64(id_bytes)`\n\nglibc_rust mapping recommendation:\n- Define an `epoch_id` that is stable within-process (and includes a monotonic counter).\n- Derive seed from `(epoch_id || build_id || mode)` to avoid collisions across runs.\n\n### Record/Envelope Mapping (What We Emit)\nFrankenSQLite’s SymbolRecord idea maps cleanly to libc evidence:\n\n- **EvidenceSymbolRecord** (proposal)\n  - Header: `{ magic, version, epoch_id, seqno, family, mode, action, flags }`\n  - Coding: `{ esi, k_source, r_repair, symbol_size_T, seed }`\n  - Integrity: `{ payload_hash (xxh3_128 or blake3), prev_hash (hash-chain) }`\n  - Payload: fixed-size `T` bytes (small; e.g., 64–256B), or padded.\n\nNotes:\n- “Auth tags” are optional: for libc evidence we may just do hash-chains + optional MAC in tooling.\n- Source symbols should be cheap to write (memcpy into ring buffer + atomic seqno).\n- Repair symbols should be generated on cadence (every N decisions, timer tick, or on exit).\n\n### Where Decode Happens\n- Runtime: encode only (systematic always; repair optional).\n- Harness/tooling: decode, verify hashes/chain, emit DecodeProof.\n\n### Open Design Choice (Explicit)\nWe must choose whether runtime implements:\n- a small XOR-only fountain (LT-like) code (fastest, simplest), or\n- a tighter RaptorQ-compatible schedule (harder), or\n- “RaptorQ-inspired” parity that tooling decodes with a matching decoder.\n\nThis is decided in `bd-3a9`.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria For The Pattern Extraction\n- A concrete mapping of the above into glibc_rust terms (epoch, record format, seed, R selection).\n- Explicit non-goals: no GF(256) Gaussian solve on hot path; no asupersync runtime dep.\n- A minimal test matrix for future implementation:\n  - drop/bitflip simulation\n  - deterministic reproduction\n  - decode-proof verification","created_at":"2026-02-09T21:50:28Z"}]}
