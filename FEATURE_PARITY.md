## Gap Summary

1. ~~No Rust libc crates in repo yet.~~ Workspace scaffold with 6 crates created.
2. Initial conformance fixtures committed (`tests/conformance/fixtures/`); full capture pending.
3. Benchmark harnesses exist, but committed baseline evidence + regression thresholds are still pending.
4. Version script scaffold created (`libc.map`); full symbol/version verification pending.
5. No formal proof artifacts are committed yet.
6. Runtime math kernel is live in membrane and pointer validation; cross-family ABI wiring remains incomplete.
7. Sequential-statistical guardrails are partially wired in runtime code; calibration evidence remains pending.
8. Bootstrap string/memory + allocator boundary implementations exist; initial strict/hardened fixture evidence is now committed (`tests/conformance/fixtures/membrane_mode_split.json`), full differential campaign remains pending.
8. Core allocator subsystem (size classes, thread cache, large allocator, MallocState) implemented with 50+ tests.
9. Stdlib numeric conversion (`atoi`, `atol`, `strtol`, `strtoul`), process control (`exit`, `atexit`), and sorting (`qsort`, `bsearch`) implemented with core logic and ABI membrane integration.
10. All string functions (mem*, str*, strtok, strtok_r, wide) implemented with comprehensive tests.
11. Tropical latency compositor live — min-plus algebra for provable worst-case pipeline bounds (math item #25).
11. Spectral phase monitor live — Marchenko-Pastur/Tracy-Widom eigenvalue edge detection for regime changes (math item #31).

## Update Policy

No entry may move to `DONE` without:

1. fixture-based conformance evidence,
2. benchmark result entry,
3. documented membrane policy behavior for that API family,
4. mode-specific strict/hardened evidence,
5. proof artifact references for applicable obligations.
