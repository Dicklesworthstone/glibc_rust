# PROPOSED_ARCHITECTURE.md

## 1. Architecture Thesis

C ABI compatibility and memory safety are reconciled via a **Transparent Safety Membrane (TSM)**.

At every `extern "C"` boundary, libc entrypoints are treated as untrusted input channels. The membrane enforces safety invariants before dispatching to safe Rust semantic kernels.

Mode is explicit and first-class:
- `strict` (default): ABI-conformant semantics, no repair rewrites.
- `hardened`: TSM repair semantics for invalid/unsafe patterns.

## 2. Layered Design

### Layer A: ABI Boundary (`extern "C"`)

Responsibilities:
- Symbol-compatible C signatures.
- Minimal pointer extraction and call-context capture.
- Immediate handoff into membrane validators.

### Layer B: Transparent Safety Membrane

Responsibilities:
- Pointer provenance classification.
- Bounds/lifetime generation checks.
- Mode-aware action selection (`strict`: allow/deny, `hardened`: allow/repair/deny).
- Evidence logging for sanitization/repair actions.

### Layer C: Safe Semantic Kernels

Responsibilities:
- Canonical behavior for libc operations in safe Rust.
- No direct raw pointer dereference.
- Deterministic and testable semantics.

### Layer D: Tooling/Conformance Plane

Responsibilities:
- Fixture capture + conformance compare.
- Traceability matrix and parity reports.
- Benchmark regressions and hotspot diagnostics.

### Layer E: Runtime Math Control Plane

Responsibilities:
- Online risk envelope updates per API family.
- Online routing of validation depth (`Fast` vs `Full`) under safety constraints.
- Runtime threshold control for repair/full-validation triggers.
- Constant-time barrier admissibility checks.
- Incremental overlap-consistency checks for sharded metadata.

### Layer F: Artifact Compilation Boundary

Responsibilities:
- Convert heavy advanced-math outputs into runtime-friendly artifacts (tables, generated constants, certified rewrites).
- Keep online control kernels simple, deterministic, and low overhead.
- Ensure ordinary contributors work against plain Rust interfaces, not theorem machinery.

## 3. TSM Formal Model (Alien-Artifact Direction)

### 3.1 State and Semantics

Define operational state:

`S = (heap, meta, errno, mode, telemetry)`

Mode-specific semantics for function `f`:

`[[f]]_strict : (S, I) -> (S', O)`

`[[f]]_hardened : (S, I) -> (S', O, R)`

where:
- `I` is ABI input tuple,
- `O` is ABI-visible output tuple,
- `R` is optional repair evidence record.

Define region state lattice:

- `Invalid`
- `Freed`
- `Quarantined`
- `Valid`

Transitions are monotone toward safer states under uncertainty (`Valid -> Quarantined` allowed; unsafe resurrection disallowed).

Each ABI operation computes a safety judgment:

`J = (provenance, bounds, temporal_state, operation_kind)`

Membrane decision function:

`D(mode, J) -> {Allow, Repair(strategy), Deny(errno)}`

Mode guard:
- `mode = strict` => `Repair` is not admissible.
- `mode = hardened` => `Repair` admissible per policy table.

Repair strategy examples:
- size clamp (`memcpy`, `memmove`, `memset`)
- termination-preserving truncation (`strcpy`, `strcat` families)
- quarantine and no-op on temporal invalid frees
- deterministic safe fallback return for irreparable operations
