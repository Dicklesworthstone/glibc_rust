- [ ] `TODO-0107` Add a drift triage report artifact with per-symbol deltas.

## 2) P0 Replacement Readiness

- [ ] `TODO-0201` Triage replacement guard report and enumerate all `GlibcCallThrough` blockers by module.
- [ ] `TODO-0202` Prioritize blockers by workload impact (`tests/conformance/workload_matrix.json` mapping).
- [ ] `TODO-0203` Eliminate highest-impact call-throughs first: allocator/threading/string families.
- [ ] `TODO-0204` Eliminate remaining call-throughs in loader/resolver/locale families.
- [ ] `TODO-0205` Re-run `scripts/check_replacement_guard.sh replacement` until zero forbidden call-throughs.
- [ ] `TODO-0206` Add regression test to prevent reintroduction of replacement-mode call-throughs.

## 3) P0 Fixture Schema Stability

- [ ] `TODO-0301` Fix fixture schema heterogeneity causing skip in verify flow:
- [ ] `TODO-0302` `elf_loader.json` missing `expected_errno` for cases expected by `FixtureCase`.
- [ ] `TODO-0303` `resolver.json` has non-string `expected_output` while harness expects string.
- [ ] `TODO-0304` Decide canonical schema for `expected_output` (string-only vs tagged value).
- [ ] `TODO-0305` Implement schema adapter in loader if mixed typing remains necessary.
- [ ] `TODO-0306` Add schema validation script for all fixture files.
- [ ] `TODO-0307` Add integration test to ensure `harness verify` processes all fixture files (no silent skips).

## 4) P0 Harness/Conformance Migration (Phase B+)

- [x] `TODO-0401` Introduce execution adapter seam crate (`frankenlibc-fixture-exec`).
- [ ] `TODO-0402` Define target-state ownership for fixture execution logic (legacy crate vs new shared crate).
- [ ] `TODO-0403` Extract `execute_fixture_case` implementation from `frankenlibc_conformance` into owned shared crate/module.
- [ ] `TODO-0404` Keep output format bit-for-bit stable during extraction (golden hash invariant).
- [ ] `TODO-0405` Decommission redundant glue in `frankenlibc_conformance` once extraction completes.
- [ ] `TODO-0406` Add migration note documenting why harness forbids `unsafe` and where host-libc unsafe calls live.

## 5) P1 Fixture Depth + Mode Coverage

- [ ] `TODO-0501` Increase hardened-mode coverage beyond current low baseline.
- [ ] `TODO-0502` Add hardened-specific fixtures for allocator anomaly repairs.
- [ ] `TODO-0503` Add hardened-specific fixtures for parser/locale boundary conditions.
- [ ] `TODO-0504` Add hardened-specific fixtures for resolver retry/cache instability cases.
- [ ] `TODO-0505` Add strict/hardened pair fixtures for every high-risk symbol family in support matrix.
- [ ] `TODO-0506` Add fixture-coverage dashboard keyed by module family and mode.

## 6) P1 Symbol & ABI Coverage Expansion

- [ ] `TODO-0601` Expand implemented symbol coverage for top blocker modules in `support_matrix.json`.
- [ ] `TODO-0602` For each newly implemented symbol, add fixture entry and expected output.
- [ ] `TODO-0603` Keep `version_scripts/libc.map` parity checks in lockstep with symbol additions.
- [ ] `TODO-0604` Add per-family acceptance thresholds tied to replacement readiness.

## 7) P1 Runtime-Mode Governance

- [ ] `TODO-0701` Verify process-immutable mode selection (`FRANKENLIBC_MODE`) across all entrypoints.
- [ ] `TODO-0702` Add explicit startup-mode evidence line in structured logs for every harness campaign.
- [ ] `TODO-0703` Add test coverage for mode mismatch handling in subprocess-orchestrated flows.

## 8) P1 Runtime Math Kernel Contract Tracking

- [ ] `TODO-0801` Reconcile mandatory live runtime_math module list in docs with actual source tree inventory.
- [ ] `TODO-0802` Add machine-checked linkage report for all required kernels under `runtime_math/mod.rs`.
- [ ] `TODO-0803` Ensure production-monitor classification policy remains consistent with governance artifacts.
- [ ] `TODO-0804` Ensure retired/experimental kernel sets cannot leak into production-monitor set.
- [ ] `TODO-0805` Add CI gate: required modules present + linked + classified.

## 9) P1 Tooling Requirements (/dp/asupersync + /dp/frankentui)

- [ ] `TODO-0901` Verify deterministic orchestration path always uses `/dp/asupersync` when feature-enabled.
- [ ] `TODO-0902` Verify diff/snapshot UI path uses `/dp/frankentui` when feature-enabled.
- [ ] `TODO-0903` Add explicit “tooling only, not runtime dependency” audit assertions in CI.

## 10) P2 Architecture Documentation Hygiene

- [ ] `TODO-1001` Add architecture diagram from workspace crates to major artifact flows.
- [ ] `TODO-1002` Add migration-state section (interpose-ready vs replacement-ready by module family).
- [ ] `TODO-1003` Add glossary for strict/hardened semantics in fixture and report context.
- [ ] `TODO-1004` Add contributor quickstart for reproducing all gates locally in deterministic order.

## 11) Immediate Next Execution Queue

- [~] `NEXT-0001` Regenerate/normalize fixture schemas so verify path stops skipping `elf_loader.json` and `resolver.json`.
- [ ] `NEXT-0002` Close support-matrix vs reality-report drift with a single canonical generation pass.
- [ ] `NEXT-0003` Burn down highest-impact replacement call-through blockers and re-run replacement guard.
