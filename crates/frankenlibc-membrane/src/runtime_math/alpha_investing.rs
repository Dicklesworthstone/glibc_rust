//! Alpha-Investing FDR Controller (Foster & Stine 2008)
//!
//! Controls the false discovery rate of escalation alarms across the
//! runtime_math monitor ensemble. Many monitors run in parallel, each
//! producing alarm/warning states. Without FDR control, the compound
//! false alarm rate grows with the number of monitors — naive additive
//! bonuses over-escalate, triggering unnecessary full-validation or
//! repair on the hot path.
//!
//! ## Mathematical Foundation
//!
//! **Alpha-Investing** (Foster & Stine, "Alpha-Investing: A Procedure
//! for Sequential Control of Expected False Discoveries", JRSS-B 2008):
//!
//! Maintain a "wealth" W(t) that controls how aggressively alarms are
//! accepted. At each step t when a monitor raises an alarm:
//!
//! 1. **Spend**: allocate α(t) ≤ W(t-1) · spend_fraction to test this alarm.
//! 2. **Test**: if the alarm's evidence (e-value or severity) exceeds 1/α(t),
//!    accept the alarm as a true discovery.
//! 3. **Update wealth**:
//!    - Rejection (true discovery): W(t) = W(t-1) - α(t) + reward
//!    - Non-rejection: W(t) = W(t-1) - α(t)
//!
//! The reward for true discoveries (ω) ensures that under the null,
//! E[discoveries] ≤ W(0) / ω, giving mFDR control.
//!
//! ## Key Invariants
//!
//! 1. Wealth is always non-negative: W(t) ≥ 0.
//! 2. Wealth is bounded above by initial_wealth + total_rewards.
//! 3. Spending per test is bounded: α(t) ≤ W(t-1) · spend_fraction.
//! 4. When wealth is exhausted, all alarms are suppressed (conservative).
//!
//! ## Legacy Anchor
//!
//! `malloc`/`nptl` — concurrent allocator and thread pool produce many
//! independent alarm signals (UAF, double-free, race detection). Without
//! FDR control, the system escalates to full-validation on every call
//! path whenever a handful of noisy monitors spike simultaneously.
