//! # Bifurcation Proximity Detector
//!
//! Detects when the controller severity process is approaching a
//! qualitative regime change (bifurcation) via critical slowing down
//! — the universal early warning signal for bifurcations in dynamical
//! systems.
//!
//! ## Mathematical Foundation
//!
//! **Normal Form Bifurcation Theory** (Guckenheimer & Holmes 1983,
//! Kuznetsov 2004): A dynamical system x' = f(x, mu) undergoes a
//! bifurcation at parameter mu* when the qualitative behavior changes.
//! Key bifurcation types:
//!
//! 1. **Saddle-node** (fold): A stable and unstable fixed point collide
//!    and annihilate. Detected when det(Df) -> 0.
//! 2. **Hopf**: A fixed point loses stability as eigenvalues cross the
//!    imaginary axis. Detected when max(Re(lambda)) crosses zero.
//!
//! For a discrete-time system x_{n+1} = F(x_n), bifurcations occur
//! when eigenvalues of the Jacobian cross the unit circle:
//! - Saddle-node: lambda = 1 (fold)
//! - Period-doubling: lambda = -1 (flip)
//! - Neimark-Sacker: |lambda| = 1 (torus)
//!
//! ## Critical Slowing Down
//!
//! Near a bifurcation, the dominant eigenvalue lambda_1 of the
//! linearized system approaches the stability boundary. The recovery
//! time from perturbations diverges as:
//!
//! ```text
//! t_recovery ~ 1 / |1 - |lambda_1||
//! ```
//!
//! This manifests as increased **lag-1 autocorrelation** in the
//! observed time series — the system takes longer to "forget" its
//! previous state. Specifically:
//!
//! ```text
//! rho_1 = Corr(X_t, X_{t+1}) -> 1  as  lambda_1 -> 1
//! ```
//!
//! This is the universal early warning signal: it applies regardless
//! of the specific bifurcation type (Scheffer et al. 2009,
//! "Early-warning signals for critical transitions", Nature).
//!
//! ## Online Estimation
//!
//! We estimate the lag-1 autocorrelation directly via EWMA:
//!
//! ```text
//! mean_x     <- EWMA of severity
//! mean_xx    <- EWMA of severity^2
//! mean_xy    <- EWMA of severity_t * severity_{t-1}
//! var_x      = mean_xx - mean_x^2
//! autocorr   = (mean_xy - mean_x^2) / max(var_x, epsilon)
//! ```
//!
//! The per-controller autocorrelation rho_i directly measures the
//! critical slowing down indicator. When max(rho_i) approaches 1,
//! at least one controller is near a bifurcation.
//!
//! ## Why Bifurcation Detection?
//!
//! Other monitors detect THAT something changed (changepoint, drift,
//! phase transition). Bifurcation detection detects IMMINENT
//! qualitative change — before it happens. It is the "early warning
//! system" for regime transitions.
//!
//! - **Changepoint** (Adams & MacKay): detects that a change HAS
//!   occurred.
//! - **Wasserstein drift**: detects distributional shift after the
//!   fact.
//! - **Bifurcation proximity**: detects that a change is ABOUT TO
//!   occur, while there is still time to intervene.
//!
//! ## Legacy Anchor
//!
//! VM transitions (`mmap`, `mprotect`, `munmap`) — protection level
//! changes create genuine bifurcations in the safety state space.
//! A memory region going from PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE to PROT_READ
//! fundamentally changes what operations are valid. The bifurcation
//! detector warns when the system is approaching such a qualitative
//! shift.
//!
//! Also: strict/hardened calibration (#12) — threshold drift near
//! a bifurcation point means tiny parameter changes produce large
//! qualitative behavioral shifts. Detecting proximity to the
//! bifurcation allows proactive recalibration.
