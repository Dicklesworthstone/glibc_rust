//! # Dobrushin Contraction Coefficient Monitor
//!
//! Detects when the severity Markov chain loses ergodicity (fails to mix)
//! via Dobrushin's contraction coefficient, measuring the worst-case
//! total variation distance between transition distributions from
//! different starting states.
//!
//! ## Mathematical Foundation
//!
//! **Dobrushin's Contraction Coefficient** (Dobrushin 1956): For a
//! Markov chain with transition matrix P, the contraction coefficient is:
//!
//! ```text
//! δ(P) = (1/2) max_{i,j} Σ_k |P(k|i) - P(k|j)|
//!       = max_{i,j} TV(P(·|i), P(·|j))
//! ```
//!
//! where TV is the total variation distance.
//!
//! Key properties:
//! - **δ ∈ [0, 1]** always.
//! - **δ = 0**: all rows of P are identical → chain mixes in one step.
//! - **δ = 1**: some pair of rows has disjoint support → chain may
//!   never mix (absorbing states, periodicity).
//! - **δ < 1**: chain is uniformly ergodic with mixing time
//!   t_mix ≤ ⌈ln(1/ε) / ln(1/δ)⌉.
//!
//! ## Why Dobrushin's Coefficient?
//!
//! Existing monitors detect WHAT is changing (distributional shift,
//! cyclic inconsistency, causal coupling). Dobrushin detects WHETHER
//! the system CAN recover:
//!
//! - **δ < 1** (ergodic): no matter the current state, the system
//!   will eventually forget it and converge to the stationary distribution.
//!   Recovery from any anomaly is guaranteed.
//! - **δ ≈ 1** (non-mixing): the system is trapped — different states
//!   lead to persistently different futures. Recovery is not guaranteed.
//!
//! This is the severity process's **self-healing capacity**: when δ is
//! small, perturbations wash out quickly. When δ is large, perturbations
//! persist indefinitely.
//!
//! ## Relationship to Mixing Time
//!
//! The mixing time t_mix(ε) = min{t : max_x TV(P^t(·|x), π) ≤ ε}
//! is bounded by:
//!
//! ```text
//! t_mix(ε) ≤ ⌈ln(1/ε) / ln(1/δ)⌉
//! ```
//!
//! So δ directly controls how fast the chain forgets its initial state.
//!
//! ## Online Estimation
//!
//! We estimate the transition matrix per-controller from observed
//! severity state transitions using EWMA smoothing, then compute δ
//! as the maximum TV distance between any pair of rows.
//!
//! The aggregate δ is the maximum across all N controllers (worst-case:
//! if ANY controller fails to mix, the ensemble has a mixing problem).
//!
//! ## Legacy Anchor
//!
//! `time`, `timezone`, `rt` timers (temporal subsystem) — temporal
//! behavior should eventually reach steady state regardless of initial
//! conditions. A timezone transition, DST change, or leap second should
//! not permanently alter the system's operating regime. Dobrushin's
//! coefficient measures whether this ergodic property holds: does the
//! severity process eventually forget transient disturbances?
