# PLAN_TO_PORT_GLIBC_TO_RUST.md

## North Star

Build a clean-room Rust libc that is:
- drop-in ABI compatible with glibc,
- full POSIX + GNU extension complete,
- memory-safe by architecture,
- verified by conformance and benchmark evidence.

This is a moonshot project. The plan is intentionally ambitious and evidence-driven.

## Non-Negotiable Contracts

1. Full POSIX coverage target with GNU compatibility where expected by real software.
2. ABI compatibility is mandatory (symbols, calling conventions, `errno`, versioning).
3. Runtime mode switch is mandatory.
4. Memory safety architecture is invented from first principles in this repo.
5. `/dp/asupersync` and `/dp/frankentui` are mandatory build/test tooling.
6. `alien-artifact-coding` and `extreme-software-optimization` are mandatory methods.

Hard requirement (verbatim):
This project must leverage:
- `/dp/asupersync` for deterministic conformance orchestration and traceability/reporting primitives.
- `/dp/frankentui` for deterministic diff/snapshot-oriented harness output and TUI-driven analysis tooling.

## Runtime Mode Contract

Mode selection:
- `GLIBC_RUST_MODE=strict|hardened`
- default: `strict`
- mode is process-level and immutable after initialization

### `strict` mode (default)
- Primary objective: strict ABI-compatible behavior.
- No semantic repair transformations.
- For defined behavior: must match reference glibc behavior contract.
- For undefined/invalid behavior: return/`errno`/signal behavior remains ABI-consistent; no hidden "helpful" rewrites.

### `hardened` mode
- Primary objective: prevent memory-unsafe outcomes through TSM repair.
- Deterministic repair policies (clamp/truncate/quarantine/safe-default/no-op) are allowed.
- Every repair path emits auditable evidence.

## Developer Transparency Contract

The alien-artifact system must be invisible to normal contributors while still
running in production through compact online control kernels.
1. Runtime codepaths exposed to most developers remain ordinary Rust and libc policy tables.
2. Runtime executes only compact deterministic kernels (risk bounds, constrained routing, barrier guards, consistency checks).
3. Heavy theorem/proof/synthesis work stays offline and emits artifacts for runtime kernels.
4. Pipelines emit plain artifacts: generated constants, certified rewrites, policy tables, and CI reports.
5. No developer is required to reason about HJI/sheaf/CEGAR/etc. to implement normal libc functions.

## Runtime Math Kernel Contract (Now Mandatory In-Code)

We are no longer "offline-only math." Runtime must carry real mathematical controllers.

### Control-plane modules (in `glibc-rs-membrane`)

1. `risk`:
- online conformal-style risk upper bounds per API family.
- output: `risk_upper_bound_ppm` used per call.

2. `bandit`:
- constrained contextual routing of `Fast` vs `Full` validation profiles.
- output: live per-call validation-depth choice.

3. `control`:
- primal-dual budget controller updating strict/hardened thresholds.
- output: `full_validation_trigger_ppm`, `repair_trigger_ppm`, request-size admissibility.

4. `barrier`:
- constant-time admissibility filter for actions that could leave safe sets.
- output: fast allow/escalate/deny gates.

5. `cohomology`:
- incremental overlap-consistency monitor for sharded metadata coherence.
- output: fault counters + fail-safe escalation trigger.

### Runtime behavior objective

For each call family, runtime decision is:
`mode + context + risk + budgets + barrier -> {Allow, FullValidate, Repair, Deny}`

with:
- strict mode preserving ABI semantics by default,
- hardened mode enabling deterministic repair under bounded risk/latency budgets.

Implementation status (now):
- live in `glibc-rs-membrane` for pointer validation,
- sampled conformal (`risk_engine`), contextual ordering (`check_oracle`), and
  primal-dual quarantine (`quarantine_controller`) are fused into runtime decisions.

### Accretive rollout (implementation order)

1. Wire runtime kernel into pointer validation path immediately (live now).
2. Extend to allocator boundary (`malloc/free/realloc`) and copy/string family.
3. Extend to `nptl`/futex paths, then resolver/NSS.
4. Extend to floating-point/fenv exceptional path routing.
5. Add cohomology overlap checks to allocator/fd metadata shards.

## Big Technical Bets

1. Dual semantic engines behind one ABI.
- `StrictEngine`: reference-compatible semantics.
- `HardenedEngine`: TSM-enforced safety semantics.
- Shared ABI veneer + shared kernel primitives to avoid drift.

2. Transparent Safety Membrane (TSM) as a programmable decision system.
- Input evidence: provenance, bounds, temporal state, operation kind, mode.
- Decision: `Allow`, `Repair(strategy)`, or `Deny(errno)` with deterministic policy tables.
- In `strict`, `Repair` is disabled by contract.

3. Memory provenance fabric (MPF).
- Allocation metadata graph (base, extent, generation, ownership class).
- Temporal safety via generations + quarantine.
- Region classification pipeline optimized for hot path and exact fallback.

4. Differential conformance factory.
- Host glibc oracle capture.
- Strict-mode differential testing against host reference.
- Hardened-mode policy-oracle testing for unsafe inputs.
- Symbol/version diffing integrated into release gates.

5. Performance autopilot.
- Profile-first optimization loop on every hotspot.
- Mode-specific latency budgets and throughput budgets.
- No optimization accepted without behavior proof and golden verification.

## Formal Objectives (Alien-Artifact Quality)

1. Monotonic safety state updates under new evidence.
2. Deterministic membrane decisions for identical inputs and mode.
3. Strict-mode conformance objective:
- maximize observational equivalence to reference glibc for defined behavior.
4. Hardened-mode safety objective:
- minimize expected harm from invalid/unsafe inputs via repair policy calculus.
5. Traceability objective:
- every repair/deny decision maps to policy id + evidence record.

Problem focus:
- constructing SIMD/memory kernels with unified geometric semantics across architectures while preserving strict ABI behavior and hardened safety guarantees.

Ultra-esoteric math:
1. Clifford algebra encodings of alignment, overlap, and lane transformations.
2. Spin/Pin symmetry constraints for directionality-sensitive operations (`memmove` overlap regimes).
3. Clifford-module normal forms for architecture-specific vector kernels.
4. Geometric-product synthesis of branch-minimized safe fast paths.

Artifact outputs:
- kernel geometry normal forms with cross-ISA equivalence witnesses,
- overlap/alignment guard generators derived from Clifford constraints,
- conformance fixtures parameterized by Clifford-class regime tags.

## Branch-Diversity Constraint (Hard Requirement)

To prevent mathematical monoculture, every major subsystem milestone must satisfy:

1. At least 3 distinct math families among:
- conformal statistics,
- algebraic topology (including spectral-sequence/obstruction methods),
- abstract algebra/representation theory,
- Grothendieck-Serre algebraic geometry/topos/descent methods,
- Atiyah-Singer/K-theory/localization index methods,
- Clifford/geometric algebra methods,
- control/game/optimization,
- logic/proof methods,
- stochastic/tail-risk methods.

2. No single family may account for more than 40% of proof obligations in that milestone.

3. At least one obligation per milestone must come from:
- conformal statistics,
- algebraic topology,
- abstract algebra,
- Grothendieck-Serre methods.

For SIMD/ABI/compatibility milestones specifically:
- at least one obligation must use Atiyah-Singer/K-theory/localization methods,
- and at least one obligation must use Clifford/geometric algebra methods.

4. All advanced methods must compile to developer-transparent artifacts (plain guards/tables/fixtures).
